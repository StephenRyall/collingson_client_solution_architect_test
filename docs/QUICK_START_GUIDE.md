## üó£Ô∏è Demo Script (5 Minutes)

### Opening (30 seconds)
> "This is a React TypeScript application demonstrating Priority Pass integration with taxi booking services. It provides a seamless door-to-lounge travel experience."

### Flight Information (1 minute)
> "Here's John Smith's upcoming flight from London Heathrow to JFK. The system displays all key details: BA281, Terminal 5, Gate A22, departing at 2:30 PM."

### Smart Departure Time (1.5 minutes)
> "The system calculates the optimal taxi pickup time using an algorithm:
> - Flight departs: 2:30 PM
> - Security buffer: 90 minutes (international flight)
> - Drive time: 45 minutes
> - Preparation: 15 minutes
> - **Recommended pickup: 12:00 PM**
>
> The visual timeline shows each step of the journey clearly."

### Taxi Booking (1 minute)
> "The booking widget pre-fills airport and terminal information. Priority Pass Prestige members automatically receive a 10% discount - ¬£45 instead of ¬£49.50. Features include professional drivers, real-time tracking, and fixed pricing."

### Lounge Access (1 minute)
> "At departure, three lounges are available at Terminal 5, including the British Airways Galleries Lounge with hot food and showers. Upon arrival at JFK, three more premium lounges await, plus the option to book a return taxi with the same discount."

### Closing (30 seconds)
> "The application is fully responsive, type-safe with TypeScript, and follows a component-based architecture for scalability. This MVP demonstrates the core integration without requiring backend services."

## üé§ Anticipated Questions & Answers

### "How do you handle real-time updates?"
**Answer**: "In this MVP, we use mock data. In production, we'd implement WebSocket connections for live driver tracking and flight status updates through an event-driven architecture."

### "How is data shared between Priority Pass and the taxi system?"
**Answer**: "Through a dedicated Integration Service that acts as an orchestrator. It enriches taxi requests with Priority Pass context (membership tier, flight details) and transforms responses for each platform's needs. No direct service-to-service communication."

### "Why not use an API Gateway for backend services?"
**Answer**: "API Gateways are for client-facing requests that need auth, rate limiting, and CORS. Backend services are in a trusted VPC and communicate directly for lower latency. The Gateway would add overhead with no security benefit."

### "How do you ensure PCI compliance?"
**Answer**: "Payment processing is handled entirely by a PCI-compliant gateway like Stripe. We never store raw card data‚Äîonly payment tokens. This reduces our PCI scope to SAQ A, the simplest compliance level."

### "What would Phase 2 include?"
**Answer**: "Real-time driver tracking via WebSocket, ML-based ETA predictions accounting for traffic, multi-currency support, comprehensive error monitoring with Sentry, and WCAG AA accessibility compliance."
