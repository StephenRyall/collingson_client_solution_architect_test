## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### TypeScript Types
- ✅ `User` - User profile with membership tier
- ✅ `Flight` - Flight details with IATA codes
- ✅ `TaxiBooking` - Booking with pricing and driver info
- ✅ `TaxiDriver` - Driver details with location
- ✅ `RecommendedDeparture` - Calculated pickup times
- ✅ `Lounge` - Lounge info with amenities
- ✅ API request/response types

### Business Logic
- ✅ **Time Calculation Algorithm**
  ```
  pickup_time = flight_departure
                - security_buffer (90/75 min)
                - drive_time (from distance)
                - preparation_buffer (15 min)
  ```
- ✅ **Discount Calculation** - 10% off for PP members
- ✅ **Date/Time Formatting** - Human-readable displays
- ✅ **Currency Formatting** - GBP with proper symbols

### Mock Data
- ✅ Sample flight (LHR → JFK)
- ✅ Sample user (Prestige member)
- ✅ 6 lounges across 2 airports
- ✅ Taxi booking with driver details
- ✅ Recommended departure calculation
