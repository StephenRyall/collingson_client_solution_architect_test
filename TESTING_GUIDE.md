## 📊 Expected Test Coverage

Based on the tests created, you should see:

| File | Coverage | Lines | Functions | Branches |

## 🎯 Test Output Example

When you run `npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false`, you should see:

```
PASS  src/services/utils/timeCalculations.test.ts
  timeCalculations
    calculateRecommendedDeparture
      ✓ should calculate correct departure time for international flight
      ✓ should calculate correct departure time for domestic flight
      ✓ should handle different drive times
      ... (25 more tests)

PASS  src/services/api/mockData.test.ts
  mockData
    mockFlight
      ✓ should have all required flight properties
      ✓ should have valid flight number format
      ... (30 more tests)

Test Suites: 3 passed, 3 total
Tests:       58 passed, 58 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        X.XXXs

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Tests Fail Due to Import Errors

**Issue:** `Cannot find module './timeCalculations'`

**Fix:**
```bash
# Ensure you're in the project directory
cd priority-pass-taxi-integration

# Reinstall dependencies
npm install
```

### Tests Fail Due to Date/Time Mocking

**Issue:** Time-based tests are flaky

**Fix:** The tests use `jest.spyOn(Date, 'now')` to mock time. If you see failures, it might be due to timezone differences. The tests are written to be timezone-agnostic, but if issues persist, check your system timezone.

### Coverage Report Not Showing

**Issue:** Coverage report doesn't appear

**Fix:**
```bash
npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false --verbose
```

### Port 3000 Conflicts

**Issue:** Tests try to start server on port 3000

**Fix:** The unit tests don't start a server. If you see this error, you might have `npm start` running. Stop it before running tests.

## 📝 What These Tests Demonstrate

### For Your Interview Presentation:

1. **Testing Best Practices**
   - Clear test structure (Arrange, Act, Assert)
   - Descriptive test names
   - Edge case coverage
   - Integration tests alongside unit tests

2. **Business Logic Validation**
   - Critical time calculation algorithm is thoroughly tested
   - Data integrity is verified
   - Edge cases are handled (early morning flights, invalid input)

3. **Code Quality**
   - Type safety with TypeScript
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Data consistency checks

4. **Professional Development Approach**
   - Tests written alongside features
   - High code coverage
   - Documentation of test purpose

## 🔄 Next Steps

### If Tests Pass ✅
```bash
# Commit the tests
git add src/services/utils/timeCalculations.test.ts
git add src/services/api/mockData.test.ts
git add TESTING_GUIDE.md
git commit -m "test: Add comprehensive unit tests for business logic

- Add 28 test cases for time calculations
